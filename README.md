# Covid-19 Cases in the Gulf Region and Some of the Developed-Industrialized-Wealthy Countries Worldwide

## Data Analytics Project


### Most countries suffer from the consequences of the new Corona Virus and their attempt to handle it with a variety of measures. Different live dashboards have been developed by authorized organizations by using a variety of visualization tools to track Covid-19 trends. The major concentration of this work was to develop a dashboard using Microsoft Power BI Desktop comparing the Covid-19 cases, recovered and deaths caused between the GCC Countries and some Developed/Industrialized/Wealthy Countries around the world. The required data was collected from worldometers.info/ website and processed in order to draw graphs to analyze and compare the outcomes of the different countries. A general trend was observed as the number of tests was greater than the population in each country. Aside from that, Saudi Arabia and USA had the highest number of cases among the six GCC Countries and the eight Developed Counties, respectively. Additionally, the total cases and conducted tests per million population in the GCC Countries are much greater than in the Developed Countries. Further researches and studies can be conducted in order to obtain a deeper insight regarding the trends of the Corona Virus cases specifically based on time series analysis.
